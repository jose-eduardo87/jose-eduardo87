- 👋 Hi, I’m Eduardo, a brazilian web developer.

- 👀 I’m interested mainly in backend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently using nodeJS and expressJS with mongoDB as noSQL database. For the frontend, I like working with React and recently I felt in love with Vue!
- 💞️ My next priority in learning are PostgreSQL as SQL database, GraphQL and improve my skills even more.

- 📫 I use these social networks pretty often, so you can reach out to me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Eduardod_Araujo) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/eduduu).
